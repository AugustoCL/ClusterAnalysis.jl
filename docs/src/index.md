# ClusterAnalysis.jl
  
This package was **Built from scratch**, entirely in [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org), and implements a few popular clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN. 

This is mostly a learning experiment, but the package were also built and documented to be used by anyone, Plug-and-Play. Just input your data as an Array or a [Tables.jl](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/tables-jl-a-table-interface-for-everyone/14071) type (like [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/)), then start training your clusters algorithms and analyze your results. 


## Algorithms Implemented
Currently we implemented two types of algorithms, a partitioned based ([K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)) and a spatial density based ([DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)). 

> Go check the `Algorithms` Section that contains all the details of how it works the algorithm and also got the bibliography and papers used during the research and development of the code.

> It's a great introduction to the algorithm and a good resource to read along with the source code.

## How to install ClusterAnalysis.jl

```julia
# press ] to enter in Pkg REPL mode.
pkg> add ClusterAnalysis
```  

## A quick example

```julia
using ClusterAnalysis, DataFrames, CSV

# load blob dataset from repo in github
df = CSV.read("algo_overview/blob_data.csv", DataFrame, drop=[1]);
X = df[:,1:2];
y = df[:,end];

# parameters of k-means
系 = 0.35;
min_pts = 10;

# executing DBSCAN
m = dbscan(X, 系, min_pts);

# plot
scatter(X[:,1], X[:,2], zcolor=m.labels, 
        leg=false, 
        title="DBSCAN prediction\n(系=$(系), minPts=$(min_pts))")
```
